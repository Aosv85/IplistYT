# iplist-youtube
Make a list of all ips that youtube uses

This is a list that keeps all ipv4 and ipv6 addresses used by Youtube. We use
DNS Lookups to achieve this and the lists are automatically updated on an random
basis mostly a couple of time in every Hour. The project is currently STABLE
BETA. So, not all ips maybe available. At present it has a collection of
**7290**
YouTube IPs.
